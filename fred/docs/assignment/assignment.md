## *What is a social media marketing strategy?*

A social media marketing strategy is a summary of everything you plan to do and hope to achieve on social media
It guides your actions and lets you know whether you're succeeding or failing.
Every post, reply, like and comment should serve a purpose.
The more specific your strategy is, the more effective the execution will be
Keep it concise
Don't make your plan so broad and unattainable to measure and achieve.
